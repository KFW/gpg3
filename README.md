ROS files needed locally on my GoPiGo3 robot named 'Finmark'. 

I'm running ROS Melodic. Overall setup is based on the book *Hands-On ROS for Robotics Programming* by Bernardo Ronquillo Jap√≥n. I'm going to try and use those packages as much as possible, but may need to bring some scripts here for customization.
